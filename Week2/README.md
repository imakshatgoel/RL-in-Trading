Week-2 will start with a brief intro on Introduction to Reinforcement Learning through this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuiWX07sKw&list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-&index=9
Then, you will work on the Multi-Arm Bandit Problem from Sutton and Barto (link in the resources folder it GitHub). Read chapters 1 and 2 from Sutton and Barto and implement the greedy and epsilon-greedy algorithms given in the work_on_bandits.iypnb file. Observe how one algorithm is better than the other and make the required changes. Good Luck!
